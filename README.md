## Introduction
Zillow Analysis project is for looking up real estate trends in the location of your choice.

This uses the public data from Zillow here(https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) to generate a report for specified metro location(s).

Caching is used when fetching the data files to speed up subsequent executions and to avoid making unnecessary web requests.
